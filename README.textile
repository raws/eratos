Eratos is a simple companion to "c10t":http://github.com/udoprog/c10t, a "Minecraft":http://minecraft.net/ cartography tool. Generate maps using a  friendly, human-readable YAML configuration instead of juggling shell scripts, command line switches and Minecraft block IDs!

"Eratosthenes":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes was a Greek thinker who up and invented geography. He also came scary close to estimating how huge the Earth is just by looking at the sun from two citiesâ€”two thousand, two hundred and some-odd years ago. Wow. That is blisteringly badass.
